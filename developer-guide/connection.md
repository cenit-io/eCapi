# Connections:

An connection named "**connection**" must be created.

**This can be:** 
* Common for all integration channels and defined in the [main namespace](namespaces?id=main-namespace).
* Custom for each integration channel and defined in the [channels namespaces](namespaces?id=channels-namespaces). 

You can manage the connections by entering [here](https://cenit.io/connection).
