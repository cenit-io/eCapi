## 1. How does it work

>The homepage is the initial page of the application, in it you can see a guide in form of cards where the fundamental steps are reflected to achieve the necessary  initial configuration for the application to start working.

<div align=center>
    <img width="800" src="/assets/images/user-guide/homepage/homepage_framed.jpg"/>
</div>

>Each card is divided into three fundamental parts:
    1- An explanation of what needs to be achieved in this step (Red box).
    2-A button with access to the section where this step can be realized (Green Box).
    3-An explanation of what would be the next step to follow (Blue box)

## 2. What each step means

>The first step leads us to the installation of the necessary integrations in order to make the application works, it contains a button that redirects us to the Available integrations view where we can perform this task (Watch the Available Integrations section)

</div>

>In the second step, it will be necessary to connect the integrations that were installed, for this you can use the button on that card to move to the Connected Integration section, where this operation can be realized (SWatchee the Connected Integrations section)

>Finally, in step number three, once our integrations are connected, import the orders and products from the connected stores, for complete this step, the button on the card will redirect us to the Workflows view in order to perform this task (Watch the Workflows section )
