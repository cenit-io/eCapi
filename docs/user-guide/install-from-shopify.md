In the background, the installation process is ongoing to configure the app for your Shopify store. Some of the installation processes include:
- Completing the configuration of the new user account for use on OMNA
- Installation of integration to support Shopify 2-way synchronisation
- Setup basic integration workflows (e.g. importing products, importing stock-locations, importing orders). For more information on other integration workflows, [click here](workflows) to find out more.

This process usually takes 1-2 minutes but could take longer during busier times. When the installation is complete, you would be presented with the page below:
