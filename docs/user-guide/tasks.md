# Tasks
Tasks are background processes that are triggered in response to an action executed by the user. When the user executes an action at the top of the application a message is displayed with the **ID** of the task that this action triggers, and a link **"GO TO TASK"** which leads to the detail view of the task. Also, at the bottom a message with the name of said action.
