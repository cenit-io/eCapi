- Completing the configuration of the new user account for use on Edge Connector App
- Installation of integration to support Shopify 2-way synchronisation
- Setup basic integration workflows (e.g. importing products, importing stock-locations, importing orders). For more information on other integration workflows, [click here](workflows) to find out more.
