**Tenants:**

# Tenants

A user can have multiple tenants. A tenant is considered a separate entity in our system, and there can't be any data sharing between tenants. 

The purpose of having multiple tenants is to allow merchants who operate multiple businesses or business units to segregate their data into separate entities. 

Each tenant will require its own subscription plan, and usage quota cannot be shared among tenants even if they belong to the same user. 

To quickly switch between tenants, simply click on the "Tenants" menu on the Top Menu. 

For a more detailed view of the list of tenants, you can visit [Settings > Tenants](https://app.omna.io/tenants) via the Side Menu.
